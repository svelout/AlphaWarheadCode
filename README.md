This plugin generates an activation code for the warhead

*How it works?*

1. The round begins, the roles you set in the config will be able to use the .code command and receive the password to activate the warhead (others will not be able to)
2. To activate the warhead detonation, you need to go to the warhead activation terminal, unlock the button and enter the command .start 123456
3. If the code is correct, then the warhead will be activated, otherwise nothing will work

*Peculiarities:

1. Any role that has not received access to the code still has the opportunity to activate it (by guessing the code or receiving it from someone)
2.After each detonation cancellation, you need to enter the activation code again
3.In the config you can edit the length of the code or even make it random
